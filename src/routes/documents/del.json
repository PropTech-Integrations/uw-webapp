However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

This Marketing Brochure has been prepared to provide summary, unverified information to prospective purchasers, and to establish only a preliminary level of interest in the subject property. The information contained herein is not a substitute for a thorough due diligence investigation. Marcus \\& Millichap has not made any investigation, and makes no warranty or representation, with respect to the income or expenses for the subject property, the future projected financial performance of the property, the size and square footage of the property and improvements, the presence or absence of contaminating substances, PCB's or asbestos, the compliance with State and Federal regulations, the physical condition of the improvements thereon, or the financial condition or business prospects of any tenant, or any tenant's plans or intentions to continue its occupancy of the subject property. The information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable; however, Marcus \\& Millichap has not verified, and will not verify, any of the information contained herein, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters and makes no warranty or representation whatsoever regarding the accuracy or completeness of the information provided. All potential buyers must take appropriate measures to verify all of the information set forth herein.\n\n## NON-ENDORSEMENT NOTICE\n\nMarcus \\& Millichap is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by any commercial tenant or lessee identified in this marketing package. The presence of any corporation's logo or name is not intended to indicate or imply affiliation with, or sponsorship or endorsement by, said corporation of Marcus \\& Millichap, its affiliates or subsidiaries, or any agent, product, service, or commercial listing of Marcus \\& Millichap, and is solely included for the purpose of providing tenant lessee information about this listing to prospective customers.\n\n## ALL PROPERTY SHOWINGS ARE BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP AGENT FOR MORE DETAILS.\n\n## SPECIAL COVID-19 NOTICE\n\nAll potential buyers are strongly advised to take advantage of their opportunities and obligations to conduct thorough due diligence and seek expert opinions as they may deem necessary, especially given the unpredictable changes resulting from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Marcus \\& Millichap has not been retained to perform, and cannot conduct, due diligence on behalf of any prospective purchaser. Marcus \\& Millichap's principal expertise is in marketing investment properties and acting as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Marcus \\& Millichap and its investment professionals cannot and will not act as lawyers, accountants, contractors, or engineers. All potential buyers are admonished and advised to engage other professionals on legal issues, tax, regulatory, financial, and accounting matters, and for questions involving the property's physical condition or financial outlook. Projections and pro forma financial statements are not guarantees and, given the potential volatility created by COVID-19, all potential buyers should be comfortable with and rely solely on their own projections, analyses, and decision-making.)\n\n## MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP HEREBY ADVISES ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF SINGLE TENANT NET LEASED PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS:\n\nThe information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

This Marketing Brochure has been prepared to provide summary, unverified information to prospective purchasers, and to establish only a preliminary level of interest in the subject property. The information contained herein is not a substitute for a thorough due diligence investigation. Marcus \\& Millichap has not made any investigation, and makes no warranty or representation, with respect to the income or expenses for the subject property, the future projected financial performance of the property, the size and square footage of the property and improvements, the presence or absence of contaminating substances, PCB's or asbestos, the compliance with State and Federal regulations, the physical condition of the improvements thereon, or the financial condition or business prospects of any tenant, or any tenant's plans or intentions to continue its occupancy of the subject property.

All potential buyers must take appropriate measures to verify all of the information set forth herein.\n\n## NON-ENDORSEMENT NOTICE\n\nMarcus \\& Millichap is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by any commercial tenant or lessee identified in this marketing package. The presence of any corporation's logo or name is not intended to indicate or imply affiliation with, or sponsorship or endorsement by, said corporation of Marcus \\& Millichap, its affiliates or subsidiaries, or any agent, product, service, or commercial listing of Marcus \\& Millichap, and is solely included for the purpose of providing tenant lessee information about this listing to prospective customers.\n\n## ALL PROPERTY SHOWINGS ARE BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP AGENT FOR MORE DETAILS.\n\n## SPECIAL COVID-19 NOTICE\n\nAll potential buyers are strongly advised to take advantage of their opportunities and obligations to conduct thorough due diligence and seek expert opinions as they may deem necessary, especially given the unpredictable changes resulting from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Marcus \\& Millichap has not been retained to perform, and cannot conduct, due diligence on behalf of any prospective purchaser. Marcus \\& Millichap's principal expertise is in marketing investment properties and acting as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Marcus \\& Millichap and its investment professionals cannot and will not act as lawyers, accountants, contractors, or engineers. All potential buyers are admonished and advised to engage other professionals on legal issues, tax, regulatory, financial, and accounting matters, and for questions involving the property's physical condition or financial outlook. Projections and pro forma financial statements are not guarantees and, given the potential volatility created by COVID-19, all potential buyers should be comfortable with and rely solely on their own projections, analyses, and decision-making.)\n\n## MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP HEREBY ADVISES ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF SINGLE TENANT NET LEASED PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS:\n\nThe information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

It is intended to be reviewed only by the party receiving it from Marcus \\& Millichap and should not be made available to any other person or entity without the written consent of Marcus \\& Millichap. This Marketing Brochure has been prepared to provide summary, unverified information to prospective purchasers, and to establish only a preliminary level of interest in the subject property. The information contained herein is not a substitute for a thorough due diligence investigation. Marcus \\& Millichap has not made any investigation, and makes no warranty or representation, with respect to the income or expenses for the subject property, the future projected financial performance of the property, the size and square footage of the property and improvements, the presence or absence of contaminating substances, PCB's or asbestos, the compliance with State and Federal regulations, the physical condition of the improvements thereon, or the financial condition or business prospects of any tenant, or any tenant's plans or intentions to continue its occupancy of the subject property. The information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable; however, Marcus \\& Millichap has not verified, and will not verify, any of the information contained herein, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters and makes no warranty or representation whatsoever regarding the accuracy or completeness of the information provided. All potential buyers must take appropriate measures to verify all of the information set forth herein.\n\n## NON-ENDORSEMENT NOTICE\n\nMarcus \\& Millichap is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by any commercial tenant or lessee identified in this marketing package. The presence of any corporation's logo or name is not intended to indicate or imply affiliation with, or sponsorship or endorsement by, said corporation of Marcus \\& Millichap, its affiliates or subsidiaries, or any agent, product, service, or commercial listing of Marcus \\& Millichap, and is solely included for the purpose of providing tenant lessee information about this listing to prospective customers.\n\n## ALL PROPERTY SHOWINGS ARE BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP AGENT FOR MORE DETAILS.\n\n## SPECIAL COVID-19 NOTICE\n\nAll potential buyers are strongly advised to take advantage of their opportunities and obligations to conduct thorough due diligence and seek expert opinions as they may deem necessary, especially given the unpredictable changes resulting from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Marcus \\& Millichap has not been retained to perform, and cannot conduct, due diligence on behalf of any prospective purchaser. Marcus \\& Millichap's principal expertise is in marketing investment properties and acting as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Marcus \\& Millichap and its investment professionals cannot and will not act as lawyers, accountants, contractors, or engineers. All potential buyers are admonished and advised to engage other professionals on legal issues, tax, regulatory, financial, and accounting matters, and for questions involving the property's physical condition or financial outlook. Projections and pro forma financial statements are not guarantees and, given the potential volatility created by COVID-19, all potential buyers should be comfortable with and rely solely on their own projections, analyses, and decision-making.)\n\n## MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP HEREBY ADVISES ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF SINGLE TENANT NET LEASED PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS:\n\nThe information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

The information contained herein is not a substitute for a thorough due diligence investigation. Marcus \\& Millichap has not made any investigation, and makes no warranty or representation, with respect to the income or expenses for the subject property, the future projected financial performance of the property, the size and square footage of the property and improvements, the presence or absence of contaminating substances, PCB's or asbestos, the compliance with State and Federal regulations, the physical condition of the improvements thereon, or the financial condition or business prospects of any tenant, or any tenant's plans or intentions to continue its occupancy of the subject property.

All potential buyers are admonished and advised to engage other professionals on legal issues, tax, regulatory, financial, and accounting matters, and for questions involving the property's physical condition or financial outlook. Projections and pro forma financial statements are not guarantees and, given the potential volatility created by COVID-19, all potential buyers should be comfortable with and rely solely on their own projections, analyses, and decision-making.)\n\n## MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP HEREBY ADVISES ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF SINGLE TENANT NET LEASED PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS:\n\nThe information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

All potential buyers must take appropriate measures to verify all of the information set forth herein.\n\n## NON-ENDORSEMENT NOTICE\n\nMarcus \\& Millichap is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by any commercial tenant or lessee identified in this marketing package. The presence of any corporation's logo or name is not intended to indicate or imply affiliation with, or sponsorship or endorsement by, said corporation of Marcus \\& Millichap, its affiliates or subsidiaries, or any agent, product, service, or commercial listing of Marcus \\& Millichap, and is solely included for the purpose of providing tenant lessee information about this listing to prospective customers.\n\n## ALL PROPERTY SHOWINGS ARE BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.

Marcus \\& Millichap's principal expertise is in marketing investment properties and acting as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Marcus \\& Millichap and its investment professionals cannot and will not act as lawyers, accountants, contractors, or engineers. All potential buyers are admonished and advised to engage other professionals on legal issues, tax, regulatory, financial, and accounting matters, and for questions involving the property's physical condition or financial outlook. Projections and pro forma financial statements are not guarantees and, given the potential volatility created by COVID-19, all potential buyers should be comfortable with and rely solely on their own projections, analyses, and decision-making.)\n\n## MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP HEREBY ADVISES ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF SINGLE TENANT NET LEASED PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS:\n\nThe information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks.

Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

PLEASE CONSULT YOUR MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP AGENT FOR MORE DETAILS.\n\n## SPECIAL COVID-19 NOTICE\n\nAll potential buyers are strongly advised to take advantage of their opportunities and obligations to conduct thorough due diligence and seek expert opinions as they may deem necessary, especially given the unpredictable changes resulting from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Marcus \\& Millichap has not been retained to perform, and cannot conduct, due diligence on behalf of any prospective purchaser. Marcus \\& Millichap's principal expertise is in marketing investment properties and acting as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Marcus \\& Millichap and its investment professionals cannot and will not act as lawyers, accountants, contractors, or engineers. All potential buyers are admonished and advised to engage other professionals on legal issues, tax, regulatory, financial, and accounting matters, and for questions involving the property's physical condition or financial outlook. Projections and pro forma financial statements are not guarantees and, given the potential volatility created by COVID-19, all potential buyers should be comfortable with and rely solely on their own projections, analyses, and decision-making.)\n\n## MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP HEREBY ADVISES ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF SINGLE TENANT NET LEASED PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS:\n\nThe information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

This Marketing Brochure has been prepared to provide summary, unverified information to prospective purchasers, and to establish only a preliminary level of interest in the subject property. The information contained herein is not a substitute for a thorough due diligence investigation. Marcus \\& Millichap has not made any investigation, and makes no warranty or representation, with respect to the income or expenses for the subject property, the future projected financial performance of the property, the size and square footage of the property and improvements, the presence or absence of contaminating substances, PCB's or asbestos, the compliance with State and Federal regulations, the physical condition of the improvements thereon, or the financial condition or business prospects of any tenant, or any tenant's plans or intentions to continue its occupancy of the subject property. The information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable; however, Marcus \\& Millichap has not verified, and will not verify, any of the information contained herein, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters and makes no warranty or representation whatsoever regarding the accuracy or completeness of the information provided. All potential buyers must take appropriate measures to verify all of the information set forth herein.\n\n## NON-ENDORSEMENT NOTICE\n\nMarcus \\& Millichap is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by any commercial tenant or lessee identified in this marketing package. The presence of any corporation's logo or name is not intended to indicate or imply affiliation with, or sponsorship or endorsement by, said corporation of Marcus \\& Millichap, its affiliates or subsidiaries, or any agent, product, service, or commercial listing of Marcus \\& Millichap, and is solely included for the purpose of providing tenant lessee information about this listing to prospective customers.\n\n## ALL PROPERTY SHOWINGS ARE BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP AGENT FOR MORE DETAILS.\n\n## SPECIAL COVID-19 NOTICE\n\nAll potential buyers are strongly advised to take advantage of their opportunities and obligations to conduct thorough due diligence and seek expert opinions as they may deem necessary, especially given the unpredictable changes resulting from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Marcus \\& Millichap has not been retained to perform, and cannot conduct, due diligence on behalf of any prospective purchaser. Marcus \\& Millichap's principal expertise is in marketing investment properties and acting as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Marcus \\& Millichap and its investment professionals cannot and will not act as lawyers, accountants, contractors, or engineers. All potential buyers are admonished and advised to engage other professionals on legal issues, tax, regulatory, financial, and accounting matters, and for questions involving the property's physical condition or financial outlook. Projections and pro forma financial statements are not guarantees and, given the potential volatility created by COVID-19, all potential buyers should be comfortable with and rely solely on their own projections, analyses, and decision-making.)\n\n## MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP HEREBY ADVISES ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF SINGLE TENANT NET LEASED PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS:\n\nThe information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

It is intended to be reviewed only by the party receiving it from Marcus \\& Millichap and should not be made available to any other person or entity without the written consent of Marcus \\& Millichap. This Marketing Brochure has been prepared to provide summary, unverified information to prospective purchasers, and to establish only a preliminary level of interest in the subject property. The information contained herein is not a substitute for a thorough due diligence investigation. Marcus \\& Millichap has not made any investigation, and makes no warranty or representation, with respect to the income or expenses for the subject property, the future projected financial performance of the property, the size and square footage of the property and improvements, the presence or absence of contaminating substances, PCB's or asbestos, the compliance with State and Federal regulations, the physical condition of the improvements thereon, or the financial condition or business prospects of any tenant, or any tenant's plans or intentions to continue its occupancy of the subject property. The information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable; however, Marcus \\& Millichap has not verified, and will not verify, any of the information contained herein, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters and makes no warranty or representation whatsoever regarding the accuracy or completeness of the information provided. All potential buyers must take appropriate measures to verify all of the information set forth herein.\n\n## NON-ENDORSEMENT NOTICE\n\nMarcus \\& Millichap is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by any commercial tenant or lessee identified in this marketing package. The presence of any corporation's logo or name is not intended to indicate or imply affiliation with, or sponsorship or endorsement by, said corporation of Marcus \\& Millichap, its affiliates or subsidiaries, or any agent, product, service, or commercial listing of Marcus \\& Millichap, and is solely included for the purpose of providing tenant lessee information about this listing to prospective customers.\n\n## ALL PROPERTY SHOWINGS ARE BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP AGENT FOR MORE DETAILS.\n\n## SPECIAL COVID-19 NOTICE\n\nAll potential buyers are strongly advised to take advantage of their opportunities and obligations to conduct thorough due diligence and seek expert opinions as they may deem necessary, especially given the unpredictable changes resulting from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Marcus \\& Millichap has not been retained to perform, and cannot conduct, due diligence on behalf of any prospective purchaser. Marcus \\& Millichap's principal expertise is in marketing investment properties and acting as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Marcus \\& Millichap and its investment professionals cannot and will not act as lawyers, accountants, contractors, or engineers. All potential buyers are admonished and advised to engage other professionals on legal issues, tax, regulatory, financial, and accounting matters, and for questions involving the property's physical condition or financial outlook. Projections and pro forma financial statements are not guarantees and, given the potential volatility created by COVID-19, all potential buyers should be comfortable with and rely solely on their own projections, analyses, and decision-making.)\n\n## MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP HEREBY ADVISES ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF SINGLE TENANT NET LEASED PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS:\n\nThe information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

It is intended to be reviewed only by the party receiving it from Marcus \\& Millichap and should not be made available to any other person or entity without the written consent of Marcus \\& Millichap. This Marketing Brochure has been prepared to provide summary, unverified information to prospective purchasers, and to establish only a preliminary level of interest in the subject property. The information contained herein is not a substitute for a thorough due diligence investigation. Marcus \\& Millichap has not made any investigation, and makes no warranty or representation, with respect to the income or expenses for the subject property, the future projected financial performance of the property, the size and square footage of the property and improvements, the presence or absence of contaminating substances, PCB's or asbestos, the compliance with State and Federal regulations, the physical condition of the improvements thereon, or the financial condition or business prospects of any tenant, or any tenant's plans or intentions to continue its occupancy of the subject property. The information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable; however, Marcus \\& Millichap has not verified, and will not verify, any of the information contained herein, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters and makes no warranty or representation whatsoever regarding the accuracy or completeness of the information provided. All potential buyers must take appropriate measures to verify all of the information set forth herein.\n\n## NON-ENDORSEMENT NOTICE\n\nMarcus \\& Millichap is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by any commercial tenant or lessee identified in this marketing package. The presence of any corporation's logo or name is not intended to indicate or imply affiliation with, or sponsorship or endorsement by, said corporation of Marcus \\& Millichap, its affiliates or subsidiaries, or any agent, product, service, or commercial listing of Marcus \\& Millichap, and is solely included for the purpose of providing tenant lessee information about this listing to prospective customers.\n\n## ALL PROPERTY SHOWINGS ARE BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP AGENT FOR MORE DETAILS.\n\n## SPECIAL COVID-19 NOTICE\n\nAll potential buyers are strongly advised to take advantage of their opportunities and obligations to conduct thorough due diligence and seek expert opinions as they may deem necessary, especially given the unpredictable changes resulting from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Marcus \\& Millichap has not been retained to perform, and cannot conduct, due diligence on behalf of any prospective purchaser. Marcus \\& Millichap's principal expertise is in marketing investment properties and acting as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Marcus \\& Millichap and its investment professionals cannot and will not act as lawyers, accountants, contractors, or engineers. All potential buyers are admonished and advised to engage other professionals on legal issues, tax, regulatory, financial, and accounting matters, and for questions involving the property's physical condition or financial outlook. Projections and pro forma financial statements are not guarantees and, given the potential volatility created by COVID-19, all potential buyers should be comfortable with and rely solely on their own projections, analyses, and decision-making.)\n\n## MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP HEREBY ADVISES ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF SINGLE TENANT NET LEASED PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS:\n\nThe information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

Marcus \\& Millichap's principal expertise is in marketing investment properties and acting as intermediaries between buyers and sellers.

All potential buyers are admonished and advised to engage other professionals on legal issues, tax, regulatory, financial, and accounting matters, and for questions involving the property's physical condition or financial outlook. Projections and pro forma financial statements are not guarantees and, given the potential volatility created by COVID-19, all potential buyers should be comfortable with and rely solely on their own projections, analyses, and decision-making.)\n\n## MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP HEREBY ADVISES ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF SINGLE TENANT NET LEASED PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS:\n\nThe information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

Vernon is uniquely situated at the convergence of three major rail lines: Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific, and Evansville Western railways converge in the city limits with spurs to all directions. Businesses can ship and receive bulk materials easily and inexpensively nationwide.\n- Mount Vernon, known as \"Festival Arts City,\" is a city in and the county seat of Jefferson County, Illinois.\n- Jefferson County Historical Village is unique to Mt. Vernon; you can experience the past at the Historical Village as you walk through a pioneer village of authentic log cabins, featuring a calaboose (circa 1820), the Mount Olive Church (circa 1873), a one-room schoolhouse, and more.\n- Wayne Fitzgerald State Recreation Area, a 3,300-acre recreational paradise, the park offers opportunities for hunting, fishing on Rend Lake, camping, picnicking, horseback riding, hiking, and biking.\n- Mount Vernon is home to the Cedarhurst Center for the Arts, a 90-acre visual and performing arts institution. Cedarhurst celebrates the arts year-round with visual and performing arts programs for the public.\n- Mount Vernon hosts a 48-acre (190,000 m²) facility for Continental Tire the Americas. It is also home to major distribution centers for NAPA, National Railway Equipment (NREC), ALCO, and IPT (subsidiaries of NREC), along with many other smaller industries which are located in or in close proximity to the city's three industrial parks.\n- There is discussion of creating a fourth industrial park which is to be used for distribution centers in the area of the new interchange; this park would encompass 100 acres (0.40 km²) and would be eligible for Tax Increment Financing and Enterprise Zone benefits.\n\n## ST. LOUIS\n\n- Known for its iconic Gateway Arch, the St. Louis metro is situated near the geographic center of the United States, within 500 miles of one-third of the U.S. population, and it has nearly 2.8 million residents.\n- In North St. Louis, the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has a major expansion underway. The $1.7 billion 97-acre campus is set to be completed in 2025. St. Louis is also home to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n- The metro boasts numerous public and private golf courses, more than 100 parks, 200 miles of trails, and the Gateway Arch National Park.\n- Many of St. Louis' top attractions — including the Saint Louis Zoo, the Saint Louis Art Museum, the Missouri History Museum, and the Municipal Opera — are located in Forest Park. The park features golf courses and athletic fields. The St. Louis Cardinals and the St. Louis Blues are housed in nearby downtown.\n- Lake of the Ozarks is within driving distance, offering destinations for hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, and spelunking.\n- There are more than 40 colleges, universities, and technical schools in the metro, enrolling around 200,000 students a year. Washington University in St. Louis is highly ranked among U.S. universities.\n\n![img-13.jpeg](img-13.jpeg)\n\n![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg)\n\n![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg)",

This Marketing Brochure has been prepared to provide summary, unverified information to prospective purchasers, and to establish only a preliminary level of interest in the subject property. The information contained herein is not a substitute for a thorough due diligence investigation. Marcus \\& Millichap has not made any investigation, and makes no warranty or representation, with respect to the income or expenses for the subject property, the future projected financial performance of the property, the size and square footage of the property and improvements, the presence or absence of contaminating substances, PCB's or asbestos, the compliance with State and Federal regulations, the physical condition of the improvements thereon, or the financial condition or business prospects of any tenant, or any tenant's plans or intentions to continue its occupancy of the subject property.

The presence of any corporation's logo or name is not intended to indicate or imply affiliation with, or sponsorship or endorsement by, said corporation of Marcus \\& Millichap, its affiliates or subsidiaries, or any agent, product, service, or commercial listing of Marcus \\& Millichap, and is solely included for the purpose of providing tenant lessee information about this listing to prospective customers.\n\n## ALL PROPERTY SHOWINGS ARE BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.

Marcus \\& Millichap's principal expertise is in marketing investment properties and acting as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Marcus \\& Millichap and its investment professionals cannot and will not act as lawyers, accountants, contractors, or engineers. All potential buyers are admonished and advised to engage other professionals on legal issues, tax, regulatory, financial, and accounting matters, and for questions involving the property's physical condition or financial outlook. Projections and pro forma financial statements are not guarantees and, given the potential volatility created by COVID-19, all potential buyers should be comfortable with and rely solely on their own projections, analyses, and decision-making.)\n\n## MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP HEREBY ADVISES ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF SINGLE TENANT NET LEASED PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS:\n\nThe information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

It is intended to be reviewed only by the party receiving it from Marcus \\& Millichap and should not be made available to any other person or entity without the written consent of Marcus \\& Millichap. This Marketing Brochure has been prepared to provide summary, unverified information to prospective purchasers, and to establish only a preliminary level of interest in the subject property. The information contained herein is not a substitute for a thorough due diligence investigation. Marcus \\& Millichap has not made any investigation, and makes no warranty or representation, with respect to the income or expenses for the subject property, the future projected financial performance of the property, the size and square footage of the property and improvements, the presence or absence of contaminating substances, PCB's or asbestos, the compliance with State and Federal regulations, the physical condition of the improvements thereon, or the financial condition or business prospects of any tenant, or any tenant's plans or intentions to continue its occupancy of the subject property. The information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable; however, Marcus \\& Millichap has not verified, and will not verify, any of the information contained herein, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters and makes no warranty or representation whatsoever regarding the accuracy or completeness of the information provided. All potential buyers must take appropriate measures to verify all of the information set forth herein.\n\n## NON-ENDORSEMENT NOTICE\n\nMarcus \\& Millichap is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by any commercial tenant or lessee identified in this marketing package. The presence of any corporation's logo or name is not intended to indicate or imply affiliation with, or sponsorship or endorsement by, said corporation of Marcus \\& Millichap, its affiliates or subsidiaries, or any agent, product, service, or commercial listing of Marcus \\& Millichap, and is solely included for the purpose of providing tenant lessee information about this listing to prospective customers.\n\n## ALL PROPERTY SHOWINGS ARE BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP AGENT FOR MORE DETAILS.\n\n## SPECIAL COVID-19 NOTICE\n\nAll potential buyers are strongly advised to take advantage of their opportunities and obligations to conduct thorough due diligence and seek expert opinions as they may deem necessary, especially given the unpredictable changes resulting from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Marcus \\& Millichap has not been retained to perform, and cannot conduct, due diligence on behalf of any prospective purchaser. Marcus \\& Millichap's principal expertise is in marketing investment properties and acting as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Marcus \\& Millichap and its investment professionals cannot and will not act as lawyers, accountants, contractors, or engineers. All potential buyers are admonished and advised to engage other professionals on legal issues, tax, regulatory, financial, and accounting matters, and for questions involving the property's physical condition or financial outlook. Projections and pro forma financial statements are not guarantees and, given the potential volatility created by COVID-19, all potential buyers should be comfortable with and rely solely on their own projections, analyses, and decision-making.)\n\n## MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP HEREBY ADVISES ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF SINGLE TENANT NET LEASED PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS:\n\nThe information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

			"text": "# AREA OVERVIEW\n\n## MT. VERNON\n\n- Located about 80 miles southeast of St. Louis, Missouri.\n- Along with easy access to two major interstates, Mt. Vernon is uniquely situated at the convergence of three major rail lines: Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific, and Evansville Western railways converge in the city limits with spurs to all directions. Businesses can ship and receive bulk materials easily and inexpensively nationwide.\n- Mount Vernon, known as \"Festival Arts City,\" is a city in and the county seat of Jefferson County, Illinois.\n- Jefferson County Historical Village is unique to Mt. Vernon; you can experience the past at the Historical Village as you walk through a pioneer village of authentic log cabins, featuring a calaboose (circa 1820), the Mount Olive Church (circa 1873), a one-room schoolhouse, and more.\n- Wayne Fitzgerald State Recreation Area, a 3,300-acre recreational paradise, the park offers opportunities for hunting, fishing on Rend Lake, camping, picnicking, horseback riding, hiking, and biking.\n- Mount Vernon is home to the Cedarhurst Center for the Arts, a 90-acre visual and performing arts institution. Cedarhurst celebrates the arts year-round with visual and performing arts programs for the public.\n- Mount Vernon hosts a 48-acre (190,000 m²) facility for Continental Tire the Americas. It is also home to major distribution centers for NAPA, National Railway Equipment (NREC), ALCO, and IPT (subsidiaries of NREC), along with many other smaller industries which are located in or in close proximity to the city's three industrial parks.\n- There is discussion of creating a fourth industrial park which is to be used for distribution centers in the area of the new interchange; this park would encompass 100 acres (0.40 km²) and would be eligible for Tax Increment Financing and Enterprise Zone benefits.\n\n## ST. LOUIS\n\n- Known for its iconic Gateway Arch, the St. Louis metro is situated near the geographic center of the United States, within 500 miles of one-third of the U.S. population, and it has nearly 2.8 million residents.\n- In North St. Louis, the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has a major expansion underway. The $1.7 billion 97-acre campus is set to be completed in 2025. St. Louis is also home to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n- The metro boasts numerous public and private golf courses, more than 100 parks, 200 miles of trails, and the Gateway Arch National Park.\n- Many of St. Louis' top attractions — including the Saint Louis Zoo, the Saint Louis Art Museum, the Missouri History Museum, and the Municipal Opera — are located in Forest Park. The park features golf courses and athletic fields. The St. Louis Cardinals and the St. Louis Blues are housed in nearby downtown.\n- Lake of the Ozarks is within driving distance, offering destinations for hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, and spelunking.\n- There are more than 40 colleges, universities, and technical schools in the metro, enrolling around 200,000 students a year. Washington University in St. Louis is highly ranked among U.S. universities.\n\n![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)\n\n![img-13.jpeg](img-13.jpeg)\n\n![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg)",

Marcus \\& Millichap's principal expertise is in marketing investment properties and acting as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Marcus \\& Millichap and its investment professionals cannot and will not act as lawyers, accountants, contractors, or engineers. All potential buyers are admonished and advised to engage other professionals on legal issues, tax, regulatory, financial, and accounting matters, and for questions involving the property's physical condition or financial outlook.

However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

It is intended to be reviewed only by the party receiving it from Marcus \\& Millichap and should not be made available to any other person or entity without the written consent of Marcus \\& Millichap. This Marketing Brochure has been prepared to provide summary, unverified information to prospective purchasers, and to establish only a preliminary level of interest in the subject property. The information contained herein is not a substitute for a thorough due diligence investigation. Marcus \\& Millichap has not made any investigation, and makes no warranty or representation, with respect to the income or expenses for the subject property, the future projected financial performance of the property, the size and square footage of the property and improvements, the presence or absence of contaminating substances, PCB's or asbestos, the compliance with State and Federal regulations, the physical condition of the improvements thereon, or the financial condition or business prospects of any tenant, or any tenant's plans or intentions to continue its occupancy of the subject property. The information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable; however, Marcus \\& Millichap has not verified, and will not verify, any of the information contained herein, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters and makes no warranty or representation whatsoever regarding the accuracy or completeness of the information provided. All potential buyers must take appropriate measures to verify all of the information set forth herein.\n\n## NON-ENDORSEMENT NOTICE\n\nMarcus \\& Millichap is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by any commercial tenant or lessee identified in this marketing package. The presence of any corporation's logo or name is not intended to indicate or imply affiliation with, or sponsorship or endorsement by, said corporation of Marcus \\& Millichap, its affiliates or subsidiaries, or any agent, product, service, or commercial listing of Marcus \\& Millichap, and is solely included for the purpose of providing tenant lessee information about this listing to prospective customers.\n\n## ALL PROPERTY SHOWINGS ARE BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP AGENT FOR MORE DETAILS.\n\n## SPECIAL COVID-19 NOTICE\n\nAll potential buyers are strongly advised to take advantage of their opportunities and obligations to conduct thorough due diligence and seek expert opinions as they may deem necessary, especially given the unpredictable changes resulting from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Marcus \\& Millichap has not been retained to perform, and cannot conduct, due diligence on behalf of any prospective purchaser. Marcus \\& Millichap's principal expertise is in marketing investment properties and acting as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Marcus \\& Millichap and its investment professionals cannot and will not act as lawyers, accountants, contractors, or engineers. All potential buyers are admonished and advised to engage other professionals on legal issues, tax, regulatory, financial, and accounting matters, and for questions involving the property's physical condition or financial outlook. Projections and pro forma financial statements are not guarantees and, given the potential volatility created by COVID-19, all potential buyers should be comfortable with and rely solely on their own projections, analyses, and decision-making.)\n\n## MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP HEREBY ADVISES ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF SINGLE TENANT NET LEASED PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS:\n\nThe information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",

It is intended to be reviewed only by the party receiving it from Marcus \\& Millichap and should not be made available to any other person or entity without the written consent of Marcus \\& Millichap. This Marketing Brochure has been prepared to provide summary, unverified information to prospective purchasers, and to establish only a preliminary level of interest in the subject property. The information contained herein is not a substitute for a thorough due diligence investigation. Marcus \\& Millichap has not made any investigation, and makes no warranty or representation, with respect to the income or expenses for the subject property, the future projected financial performance of the property, the size and square footage of the property and improvements, the presence or absence of contaminating substances, PCB's or asbestos, the compliance with State and Federal regulations, the physical condition of the improvements thereon, or the financial condition or business prospects of any tenant, or any tenant's plans or intentions to continue its occupancy of the subject property. The information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable; however, Marcus \\& Millichap has not verified, and will not verify, any of the information contained herein, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters and makes no warranty or representation whatsoever regarding the accuracy or completeness of the information provided. All potential buyers must take appropriate measures to verify all of the information set forth herein.\n\n## NON-ENDORSEMENT NOTICE\n\nMarcus \\& Millichap is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by any commercial tenant or lessee identified in this marketing package. The presence of any corporation's logo or name is not intended to indicate or imply affiliation with, or sponsorship or endorsement by, said corporation of Marcus \\& Millichap, its affiliates or subsidiaries, or any agent, product, service, or commercial listing of Marcus \\& Millichap, and is solely included for the purpose of providing tenant lessee information about this listing to prospective customers.\n\n## ALL PROPERTY SHOWINGS ARE BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP AGENT FOR MORE DETAILS.\n\n## SPECIAL COVID-19 NOTICE\n\nAll potential buyers are strongly advised to take advantage of their opportunities and obligations to conduct thorough due diligence and seek expert opinions as they may deem necessary, especially given the unpredictable changes resulting from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Marcus \\& Millichap has not been retained to perform, and cannot conduct, due diligence on behalf of any prospective purchaser. Marcus \\& Millichap's principal expertise is in marketing investment properties and acting as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Marcus \\& Millichap and its investment professionals cannot and will not act as lawyers, accountants, contractors, or engineers. All potential buyers are admonished and advised to engage other professionals on legal issues, tax, regulatory, financial, and accounting matters, and for questions involving the property's physical condition or financial outlook. Projections and pro forma financial statements are not guarantees and, given the potential volatility created by COVID-19, all potential buyers should be comfortable with and rely solely on their own projections, analyses, and decision-making.)\n\n## MARCUS \\& MILLICHAP HEREBY ADVISES ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF SINGLE TENANT NET LEASED PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS:\n\nThe information contained in this Marketing Brochure has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. However, Marcus \\& Millichap has not and will not verify any of this information, nor has Marcus \\& Millichap conducted any investigation regarding these matters. Marcus \\& Millichap makes no guarantee, warranty or representation whatsoever about the accuracy or completeness of any information provided.\n\nAs the Buyer of a single tenant property, it is the Buyer's responsibility to independently confirm the accuracy and completeness of all material information before completing any purchase. This Marketing Brochure is not a substitute for your thorough due diligence investigation of this investment opportunity. Marcus \\& Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.\n\nAny projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this prop-erty. The value of a single tenant property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.\nBuyer and Buyer's tax, financial, legal, and construction advisors should conduct a careful, independent investigation of any single tenant property to determine to your satisfaction with the suitability of the property for your needs.\n\nLike all real estate investments, this investment carries significant risks. Buyer and Buyer's legal and financial advisors must request and carefully review all legal and financial documents related to the property and tenant. While the tenant's past performance at this or other locations is an important consideration, it is not a guarantee of future success. Similarly, the lease rate for some properties, including newly-constructed facilities or newly-acquired locations, may be set based on a tenant's projected sales with little or no record of actual performance, or comparable rents for the area. Returns are not guaranteed; the tenant and any guarantors may fail to pay the lease rent or property taxes, or may fail to comply with other material terms of the lease; cash flow may be interrupted in part or in whole due to market, economic, environmental or other conditions. Regardless of tenant history and lease guarantees, Buyer is responsible for conducting his/her own investigation of all matters affecting the intrinsic value of the property and the value of any long-term lease, including the likelihood of locating a replacement tenant if the current tenant should default or abandon the property, and the lease terms that Buyer may be able to negotiate with a potential replacement tenant considering the location of the property, and Buyer's legal ability to make alternate use of the property.\n\nBy accepting this Marketing Brochure you agree to release Marcus \\& Millichap Real Estate Investment Services and hold it harmless from any kind of claim, cost, expense, or liability arising out of your investigation and/or purchase of this single tenant property.",
